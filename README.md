# CortexiaPy-1test-Simple-AI-
Simple AI based on Python, written using numpy, skearn, and wordnet with manual training.

This was an old project of mine, conceived as a simple artificial intelligence that would learn in a simpler way than modern neural networks. 

To improve performance, libraries such as sklearn, numpy, random, and others were used. The idea was that users would be able to create, share, and apply vocabularies to this neural network.This would make communication in future versions less limited than, for example, in Chat GPT or DeepSeek.

I've been away from this project for a year now and would like to share it with you. I think there could be others who continue and improve it.
